# Phase 1.7: Knowledge Base (RAG) & Ticket Q&A Vectorization

## 1. Objective
Implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to assist agents by providing AI-generated suggestions based on existing knowledge base documents and past ticket Q&A pairs.

## 2. Architecture

### 2.1. Components
- **Cloudflare Vectorize**: Stores and searches vector embeddings.
- **Cloudflare Workers AI**: 
    - Text Embeddings: `@cf/baai/bge-large-en-v1.5`
    - Text Generation: `@cf/meta/llama-3-8b-instruct`
- **Cloudflare R2**: Stores raw knowledge base documents (.pdf, .md, .docx).
- **Cloudflare D1**: Stores metadata for knowledge documents and ticket articles.

### 2.2. Data Flow (Asynchronous Vectorization)
To guarantee zero-latency responses in the UI when creating articles or marking Q&A pairs, heavy vectorization tasks are offloaded to Cloudflare Workflows.

1. **Ingestion (Knowledge Base)**:
    - Admin creates/updates an article via the Dashboard editor.
    - Article metadata is instantly saved to D1 and full markdown body to R2.
    - A `VectorizeJob` is dispatched to the background `VectorizeWorkflow` (`action: 'create' | 'update'`).
    - The Workflow steps execute asynchronously: fetches content, deletes old vectors if updating, chunks text, generates embeddings via Workers AI, inserts into Vectorize, and finally updates the D1 status to `active`.
2. **Ingestion (Ticket Q&A)**:
    - Agent marks an article as "Q&A" (Question or Answer).
    - D1 is instantly updated, and a `VectorizeJob` is dispatched (`action: 'qa_mark'`).
    - The Workflow asynchronously retrieves the article body, chunks it, generates embeddings, and stores them in Vectorize. Unmarking purges these vectors using the same Workflow.
3. **Retrieval & Generation (Auto-Draft)**:
    - New ticket or agent reply initiates a search.
    - Input text converted to embedding.
    - Vectorize search returns top K relevant chunks/articles.
    - Prompt constructed: `Context: {retrieved_text} \n Question: {input_text} \n Suggestion:`
    - Workers AI generates response.

## 3. Technical Specification

### 3.1. Vector Index Schema
- **Namespace**: `kb` for documents, `qa` for ticket pairs.
- **Metadata**:
    - `id`: Unique identifier (UUID).
    - `source_id`: `knowledge_doc_id` or `article_id`.
    - `type`: `document` or `qa`.
    - `text`: (Optional, if small) or reference to D1/R2.

### 3.2. Services & Workflows
- `VectorService`: Wraps Vectorize API for upsert/query.
- `KnowledgeService`: Handles document parsing, chunking, and lifecycle.
- `AiService`: Wraps Workers AI for embeddings and generation.
- `VectorizeWorkflow`: A Cloudflare `WorkflowEntrypoint` class that orchestrates the multi-step background process for vector generation. It ensures robust retries and step isolation using `step.do()`.
    - **`create` / `update` (Knowledge Base)**: Steps include `fetch_content`, `delete_old_vectors`, `vectorize_content`, and `update_status`.
    - **`qa_mark` (Ticket Q&A)**: Steps include `fetch_qa_content`, `vectorize_qa`, `update_qa_status`, or `unmark_qa` (for deletion).
    - If an AI model or Vectorize indexing fails mid-process, the workflow automatically retries without repeating completed steps.

### 3.3. Database Updates
- `knowledge_docs` table: Already exists, needs `status` updates (`processing`, `active`, `error`).
- `articles` table: `qa_type` (already exists) will be used to trigger vectorization.

### 3.4. API Endpoints
- `POST /api/dashboard/knowledge`: Upload document.
- `GET /api/dashboard/knowledge`: List documents.
- `DELETE /api/dashboard/knowledge/:id`: Remove document.
- `POST /api/dashboard/articles/:id/qa`: Mark/Unmark as Q&A.
- `POST /api/dashboard/tickets/:id/ai-suggest`: Trigger AI suggestion generation.

## 4. Security & Privacy
- **Access Control**: Only authenticated agents/admins can access Vectorize data.
- **Data Isolation**: Ensure suggestions are only derived from the tenant's own data (since it's single-tenant, this is naturally handled).
- **Prompt Injection**: Sanitize input text and use strict system prompts for the AI.

## 6. Validation & Security Refinement (Final Turn)

### 6.1. Backend Robustness
- **Error Handling**: `AiService` and `VectorService` now include comprehensive `try/catch` blocks. Failures in external AI models or Vectorize indexing do not crash the Worker; instead, they return graceful fallbacks or meaningful error statuses.
- **Smart Chunking**: `KnowledgeService` implements a boundary-aware chunker that respects paragraph and sentence breaks, ensuring better semantic coherence in the vector index.
- **Q&A Lifecycle**: Marking an article as Q&A triggers a multi-chunk vectorization process. Unmarking correctly purges all related vector segments from the index.

### 6.2. Security Posture
- **Prompt Engineering**: Switched to structured `messages` format for `llama-3-8b-instruct`. Added a system prompt that enforces strict adherence to context and professional tone, significantly reducing the risk of prompt injection.
- **File Audit**: `KnowledgeService` now enforces a 10MB file size limit and restricts ingestion to safe text-based formats (`.txt`, `.md`, `.csv`). Binary formats are stored but flagged as `unsupported_type` for vectorization.
- **Vector Isolation**: Vector IDs are prefixed with `doc_` or `qa_` for easier management and clear logical separation within the single-tenant index.

### 6.3. UX Improvements
- **AI Suggestion UI**: The "Use Suggestion" feature was expanded to offer "Append" and "Replace All" options, giving agents more flexibility.
- **Visual Feedback**: Added an "INDEXED" badge with a `ShieldCheck` icon to any article currently active in the RAG system, providing immediate confirmation of agent actions.
- **Progress Indicators**: Knowledge upload now features an animated spinner and "Indexing..." state to manage agent expectations during vectorization.

## 7. Recent Architecture & Security Enhancements (Post-Migration Update)

To support the transition to the Option 3 storage architecture (R2 article body offloading) and to improve the safety and accuracy of the AI suggestions, the RAG pipeline was recently overhauled:

### 7.1. Unified Search & Tiering Logic
- **Unified Vector Querying:** The system now executes a single, unified vector search across both `answer` and `sop` knowledge tiers, replacing the older sequential query method.
- **Threshold & Top-K Adjustments:** The similarity threshold and `topK` parameters were increased to guarantee that highly specific SOPs are retained in the context window and not displaced by more generic Answer articles.

### 7.2. R2 Context Hydration
- **Body Hydration:** Because article bodies are now offloaded to Cloudflare R2 to bypass D1 storage limits, the RAG retrieval pipeline was updated to fetch the full text payload directly from R2 using the retrieved vector metadata, dynamically hydrating the context window before calling the LLM.

### 7.3. Advanced Security Mitigations
- **Prompt Injection Defense:** System prompts have been strictly hardened with explicit boundary markers and adversarial instruction safeguards to prevent user-supplied ticket text from overriding the AI's core directives.
- **DoS Memory/CPU Limits:** To prevent Denial of Service (DoS) attacks via excessive token contexts, explicit limits on the aggregated context size and CPU execution time have been enforced before passing payloads to Cloudflare Workers AI.
